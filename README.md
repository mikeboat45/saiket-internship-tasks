# SaiKet Internship
This repository contains the tasks and projects completed as part of my Frontend Development Internship at Saiket Systems. Each task is designed to strengthen my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, responsive design, UI/UX principles, and real-world frontend development workflows.

## Task 1: Portfolio Website

For this task, I developed a clean and interactive portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. The goal was to build a visually appealing online presence that highlights my projects and frontend skills. The layout includes sections for my introduction, featured projects, skills, and contact information. Styling focuses on responsive design, clarity, and modern UI elements to ensure the website looks good across devices.
